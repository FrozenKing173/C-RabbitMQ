-Goto local machine Services or run services.msc and look for RabbitMQ service and restart it.

Now you can open WongaContactDetailsServiceA.sln as 'A' and WongaContactDetailsServiceB.sln as 'B' with the latest Visual Studio and run it.

Both service a and b are basically the same application
Run A as Client when debugging and B as Server when debugging.
These services will log a file in your documents folder every time you send a message.
